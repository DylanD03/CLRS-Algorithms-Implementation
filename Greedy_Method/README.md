This program uses a greedy algorithm to calculate the lowest 'burst' value needed to climb a mountain. Where a burst value is the distance you can climb after a rest.

Input: length, rest, limit, and then (length) heights.

Where length is the number of resting points in a mountain. rest is the time it takes to rest. limit is the time it takes to climb the mountain.
And (length) heights are the heights of the resting points on a mountain. There are (length) amount of resting points.

Output: burst
